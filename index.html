    <td colspan="4"><p data-start="155" data-end="598">Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla (1753–1811) was a Mexican priest and a national hero who is known as the <strong data-start="254" data-end="288">Father of Mexican Independence</strong>. He was born on May 8, 1753, in Guanajuato, Mexico. As a young man, he studied at the Colegio de San Nicolás, where he later became a teacher and eventually the school&rsquo;s rector. Hidalgo was very intelligent and spoke several Indigenous languages, which helped him communicate with the people in his community.</p>
      <p data-start="600" data-end="891">Hidalgo became concerned about the unfair treatment of Indigenous people and poor farmers under Spanish rule. He believed that everyone deserved better living conditions and more freedom. These ideas inspired him to join a secret group that was planning to fight for independence from Spain.</p></td>
